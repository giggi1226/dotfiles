# Gigi's Dotfiles

Recently I decided to wipe my machook and set it up with only the tools i need and use often.
I have had to do this quite a few times and it got too repetative for my taste, and also got a little inspiration to work on this from one of my current favorite podcast [Developer Tea](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea) by [Jonathan Cutrell](https://twitter.com/jcutrell).

Feel free to use this repo as your baseline for your own dotfiles
